                <h2> <span>1.</span> Bupees</h2><br>
                <p> This exercise works your core, as well as your chest, shoulders, lats, triceps and quads, explains
                    Michaels. Since burpees involve explosive plyometric movement, they'll get your heart pumping too.
                    <br> How to do burpees: Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart and send your hips back as you
                    lower your body toward the ground in a low squat. Then, place your hands right outside of your feet
                    and hop your feet back, allowing your chest to touch the floor. Push your hands against the floor to
                    lift your body up into a plank and then jump your feet just outside of your hands. With your weight
                    in your heels, jump explosively into the air with your arms overhead.

                Like burpees, Michaels is a fan of this moving plank exercise because it works your core, in addition to
                a slew of other body muscles. <br>
                How to do mountain climbers: Get into a high-plank position with your wrists directly under your
                shoulders. Keep your core tight, drawing your belly button in toward your spine. Drive your right knee
                toward your chest and then bring it back to plank. Then, drive your left knee toward your chest and
                bring it back. Continue to alternate sides.

                <h2> <span>3.</span>Turkish Get-Up </h2><br>
                <p>
                    The Turkish get-up is a 200-year-old total-body exercise that involves using a kettlebell, and it's
                    a favorite of celebrity trainer Ramona Braganza. While it is slightly complicated, she says that the
                    total-body conditioning move is seriously effective. <br>How to do a Turkish get-up: Holding one
                    kettlebell by the handle with both hands, lie on your side in a fetal position. Roll onto your back
                    and press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling with both hands until the weight is stable on one
                    loaded side. Release your free arm and free leg to a 45-degree angle with your palm facing down.
                    Slide the heel of the loaded side closer to your butt to firmly grip the floor.

                    Pushing through the foot on the floor, punch the kettlebell up with the loaded arm and roll onto
                    your free forearm. Don't shrug your shoulder toward your ear with the supporting side. Be sure to
                    keep your chest wide open. Straighten the elbow on the ground and lift yourself up to a seated
                    position. Weave your front leg through to the back. To protect your knees, your shin on the back leg
                    should be perpendicular to your shin on the front leg.

                    Perfectly align your arms: wrist over elbow, shoulder over elbow over wrist. Raise your torso to
                    make your upper body erect. Swivel your back knee so that your back shin is parallel with your front
                    shin. Get a grip on the floor with your back toes, then take a deep breath, and stand up.

                <h2> <span>4.</span>Medicine Ball Burpees</h2><br>

                <p>
                    Phelps suggests adding a medicine ball to your burpee to increase the intensity of the exercise and
                    boost your metabolism—all while building a sleek set of six-pack abs. <br>
                    How to do medicine ball burpees: Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, hold a medicine
                    ball with both hands. Extend the ball up overhead, then slam the ball down on the ground as hard as
                    you can, hinging over and sitting your butt back as you slam. As you hinge over, bend your knees.
                    Place your hands on the ground outside of your feet and jump back into a high-plank position. Keep
                    your body in a straight line. Then, jump your feet back towards the outsides of your hands so that
                    you are squatting. Pick up the ball and press it overhead, extending your body and standing tall.

                <p>
                    The sprawl is basically a burpee on steroids—a full body exercise that works as many muscles as
                    possible and burns calories while shaping and toning upper- and lower-body, especially your abs. “It
                    takes the traditional burpee to the next level by having you touch your chest to the ground, then
                    push-up to plank as you continue the move,” explains Braganza. <br>
                    How to do a sprawl: Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, squat down and place your hands
                    on the ground. Jump your feet back to a plank and lower your body to touch the ground. Push yourself
                    up to a plank and then jump your feet outside of your hands into a squat. Stand back up. That’s one
                    rep. “If you want to burn even more calories, add a jump between each sprawl,” Braganza adds.

                <h2> <span>6.</span>Side-to-Side Medicine Ball Slams</h2><br>

                <p>
                    “Medicine ball slams are a dynamic, explosive, and highly metabolic exercise that does not simply
                    target one muscle group,” explains Chris DiVecchio, trainer and founder of Premier Body & Mind. On
                    the surface, the obliques, hamstrings, quads, biceps, and shoulders are the primary movers of this
                    exercise. “But as time goes on and fatigue sets in, nearly every other muscle in the body, in one
                    way or another, may become involved as a secondary mover,” he adds. Doing side-to-side ball slams
                    versus overhead slams incorporates more oblique ab work. <br>How to do lateral medicine ball slams:
                    Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart with the medicine ball on one side. Pick up the ball
                    and simply rotate your body as you slam the ball a few inches away from your pinky toe. Make sure to
                    pivot your feet and bend the back knee as you come into a split squat position to catch the ball on
                    one bounce. Alternate sides. Make sure you tighten your core as you bring the ball overhead and to
                    the side.

                <h2> <span>7.</span>Overhead Medicine Ball Slams </h2><br>Overhead medicine ball slams strengthen your
                core as it works against gravity. This exercise also tests your endurance, getting your heart rate up
                each time you pick the ball up and bring it overhead. To get the most out of this exercise, be sure to
                use a heavy weighted ball. <br>How to do overhead medicine ball slams: Standing tall with your feet
                hip-width apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Reach both arms overhead, fully extending your
                body. Slam the ball forward and down toward the ground. Extend your arms toward the ground as you slam
                and don’t be afraid to bend your knees as you hinge over. Squat to pick the ball up and then stand back
                up.

                <h2><span>8.</span>Russian Twists</h2>
                <p>
                    The Russian twist is a core exercise that improves oblique strength and definition, explains
                    DiVecchio. The move, typically performed with a medicine ball or plate, involves rotating your torso
                    from side to side while holding a sit-up position with your feet off the ground. <br>How to do
                    Russian twists: Sit up tall on the floor with your knees bent and feet off the ground. Hold a
                    medicine ball with your hands at chest height. Lean backward with a long, tall spine, holding your
                    torso at a 45-degree angle and keeping your arms a few inches away from your chest. From here, turn
                    your torso to the right, pause and squeeze your right oblique muscles, then turn your torso to the
                    left and pause to squeeze your left oblique muscles. The movement should come from your ribs and not
                    your arms.
